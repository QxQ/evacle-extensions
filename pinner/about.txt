pinner

adds a pin tab button so you don't have to right click to pin or unpin.

this application puts a pin to the right of your address bar. click it to pin or unpin a tab. this is useful to people who pin and unpin tabs a lot and hates the lengthy process of right clicking and finding the "pin tab" option.

you might also like "close pinned tab" close a pinned tab without right clicking

thank you to these to websites for their images of pins:

also thanks to livibetter who created the application "keep last two tabs". I used his code as a kickstart to make this application.
