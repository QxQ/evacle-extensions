window manager

lets you manage your windows in the click of a button. comparable to firefox's panorama

firefox has a simple way to switch between groups of tabs. this extension brings a simular solution. instead of groups of tabs, it will switch between different windows.

note: screenshots don't always show up. there are a couple of reasons why a screenshot can't be taken. google's websites and websites beginning with chrome:// can't have screenshots. screenshots can only be taken from active tabs. if you open a tab without viewing it, a screenshot won't be taken from it.
